# Konverter 
Konverter is a simple application which allows users to convert pictures to PDF files, or .txt files to Ebooks.
<br>
The Motivation behind it was using a conversion website one day, and it being incredibly slow, and alternatives having a<br/> usage limit.


##Layout
The project consists of two folders: Backend and Frontend.
<br>
These folders indicate what they contain. (i.e. the backend and frontend code, albeit separate).

##How-to
#### Frontend
To run the frontend, simply run the ``npm run dev`` command while in the `konverter-frontend` folder.

#### Backend
Running the backend is tad more complicated, but simply run the `App.java` file. The backend is a Spring application, </br>
therefore simply running it should suffice. Although the required maven dependencies should be installed.
